# Crypto Analysis

## Purpose: 
The purpose of this analysis was to use unsupervised machine learning to process, cluster, reduce the dimensions, and reduce the principal components using PCA to create an analysis for the clients who are preparing to get into the cryptocurrency market. We were to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment. To group the cryptocurrencies, we decided on a clustering algorithm. Th data visualizations will then be used to share these findings with the board.

# Analysis used:
- Cleaned and preapred the preprocessing Data for PCA
- Reduced the dimensions using PCA
- Used K-Means to cluster
- Visualized the Cryptocurrencies and Findings
